                <h1>Terms</h1>
                <p> Welcome to Chalkable (a.k.a. "we" or "us" or the “Service” or the "Company"). We are excited you actually took a minute to peruse this page. Your school or other responsible party (the "Account Holder") has made Chalkable available to you (the "User") subject to the following Terms. The following terms and conditions (collectively, these "Terms of Service" or “Terms”) apply to your use of <a href="https://www.chalkable.com">www.chalkable.com</a>, including any content, functionality and services offered on or via Chalkable.com (the "Website"). The Terms of Service also include our Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p>We will do our best to keep our relationship with you as simple as possible because we know reading documents like these can sometimes be less than fun, but please do read the Terms of Service carefully before you start using Chalkable, because by using the Website you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms of Service. Should you disagree with some of the provisions included here, you can either leave the Website (although that would make us sad), or contact us at <a href="mailto:support@chalkable.com">support@chalkable.com</a>.</p>
                <strong>Changes to the Terms</strong>
                <p>If there is a change made in Chalkable policy, we will post those changes to this statement as well as other places we deem appropriate so that users are aware that a change was made. We reserve the right to change this statement at any time without notice. We don’t plan to make many changes, but please understand that this is something we need to be able to do so that we can keep our policies flexible as we grow. If we make, what we deem as “material changes” to how we use Personal Information, we will notify you by email if possible or by another means of notice if possible. We take this topic seriously and will do our best to use good judgement. The way we think about it is, “what would I want a company to do with MY data.”</p>
